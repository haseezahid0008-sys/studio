## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Clean, fresh light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of hygiene and clarity associated with cleaning products. The lightness mirrors daytime activity related to the product line.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) to maintain a clean and airy feel, allowing the data to stand out.
- Accent color: A contrasting vibrant yellow (#FFD700) to highlight key metrics and CTAs, drawing attention to important data points. This sits about 30 degrees to the left of the primary hue.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, offering a modern and geometric feel, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a humanist touch.
- Responsive layout adaptable to both web and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and usability across different screen sizes.
- Simple, minimalist icons representing each product category (Soap, Snow Powder, Bleach, etc.) for quick visual identification.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback on user interactions, enhancing user engagement without being distracting.
